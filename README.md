# hello_app
This is another hello world app. This is pretty short

I am simply following the directions on [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning). I will not be implementing very many ideas from any previous tutorials as this is just a hello world application. The bellow is a quick reference to what will be covered.

  - [Github](github.com) obviously
  - [Bitbucket](bitbucket.com) very similar to github
  - [Heroku](heroku.com)
