# hello_app
This is another hello world app. This is pretty short
[final product](https://gentle-shelf-63578.herokuapp.com/)
I am simply following the directions on [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning). I will not be implementing very many ideas from any previous tutorials as this is just a hello world application. The bellow is a quick reference to what will be covered.

  - [Github](github.com) obviously
  - [Bitbucket](bitbucket.com) very similar to github
  - [Heroku](heroku.com)

## My Lessons Learned from this tutorial
* Bitbucket is a better repo for private projects
* Pushing to Bitbucket and github are a two command process when converting one to the other for the most part.
  1. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/xxerror500xx/hello_app.git
  2. git push -u origin master
* Some nuisances dealing with ssh keys
* How to create a project from the command line using heroku.
